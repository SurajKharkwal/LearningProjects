# ShortUrl
The website in question is a straightforward platform designed to shorten URLs. However, it comes with a unique restriction â€“ the shortened links can only be accessed from within the confines of the website's domain. While it may limit external access, this feature can be valuable in certain contexts, ensuring that the shortened URLs are only accessible to those already within the website's ecosystem. This can be particularly useful for maintaining the integrity and security of the links shared on the platform.
